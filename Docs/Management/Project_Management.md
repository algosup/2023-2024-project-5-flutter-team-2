# Project Management 

## Team rules

### Strict rules

These rules, decided by the Project Manager Paul NOWAK, have been established to monitor the other student's behavior, and make sure they are committed to work seriously and respectfully during this project.

**RULE N°1:** During project time, **ENGLISH** is the only language spoken during project time. If a student is seen speaking French at least 5 times during a class, they will receive a warning.

**RULE N°2:** Any absence during project class should be reported by the missing person as soon as possible through Slack.

**RULE N°3:** Any inappropriate behavior towards another member of the group, such as any form of bullying or entravement to his work, is not accepted.

**RULE N°4:** The use of the laptop and the cellphone is only limited to the project work, to any ALGOSUP related information, or for urgent personal reasons. Playing games and using social medias is completely forbidden.

**RULE N°5:** Resting our feet on the table to work or relax is unprofessionnal and forbidden.

**RULE N°6:** Any form of weariness in this project is disrespectful for the team and for the client.

**RULE N°7:** Any student wanting to leave the room during project class (personal reasons, need of help from another team) must report to the project manager.

Each time a student breaks a rule, the project manager will give him a warning. 

### Warnings

Each student has a warning counter set to 0 at the beginning of the week.

Each time a student break a strict rule, they will receive a warning from the Project Manager.

At the second warning of the week, the project manager is in the right to require a meeting with the troubling student to discuss his behavior.

At the third warning of the week, the project manager will report to any member of the ALGOSUP main school staff, Franck, Natasha or Jean-Philippe, about the student. They could have the possibility to summon the student at their office.

### Secondary rules

These rules are additionary advices to ensure the organization of this project.

**Secondary rule n°1:** No one has to work or update the main branch without the supervision of the project manager.

**Secondary rule n°2:** Any use of any AI-enhanced tool such as ChatGPT must be reported to the Project Manager.

In general, any breaking of thes rules shouldn't lead to a warning, but it could create potential roadblocks for the project's progression.
