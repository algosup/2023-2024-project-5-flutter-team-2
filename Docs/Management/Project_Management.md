# Project Management 

## Team rules

### Strict rules

These rules, decided by the Project Manager Paul NOWAK, have been established to monitor the other student's behavior, and make sure they are committed to work seriously and respectfully during this project.

**RULE N°1:** During project time, **ENGLISH** is the only language spoken during project time. If a student is seen speaking French at least 5 times during a class, they will receive a warning.

**RULE N°2:** Any absence during project class should be reported by the missing person as soon as possible through Slack.

**RULE N°3:** Any inappropriate behavior towards another member of the group, such as any form of bullying or entravement to his work, is not accepted.

**RULE N°4:** The use of the laptop and the cellphone is only limited to the project work, to any ALGOSUP related information, or for urgent personal reasons. Playing games and using social medias is completely forbidden.

**RULE N°5:** Resting our feet on the table to work or relax is unprofessionnal and forbidden.

**RULE N°6:** Any form of weariness in this project is disrespectful for the team and for the client.

**RULE N°7:** Any student wanting to leave the room during project class (personal reasons, need of help from another team) must report to the project manager.

Each time a student breaks a rule, the project manager will give him a warning. 

### Warnings

Each student has a warning counter set to 0 at the beginning of the week.

Each time a student break a strict rule, they will receive a warning from the Project Manager.

At the second warning of the week, the project manager is in the right to require a meeting with the troubling student to discuss his behavior.

At the third warning of the week, the project manager will report to any member of the ALGOSUP main school staff, Franck, Natasha or Jean-Philippe, about the student. They could have the possibility to summon the student at their office.

### AI use
In this project, we tolerate the use of AI enhanced tools such as CHATGPT, but any use of them should be reported to the Project Manager. Indeed it's important to be aware of any work completed through AI so we could review their veracity and avoid to overuse it to not decrease the documentation's quality.

As a matter of fact, each document modified using AI should always be reviewed entirely by a human person.

The advised use cases of AI are the following:

- Getting advices from **ChatGPT** on how to write a certain document, and balancing their use alongside our personal experience.
- Checking the grammar and vocabulary of a document/text.
- Restructuring a plan depending on the user's conditions.

### Other rules

These rules are additionary advices to ensure the organization of this project.

**Secondary rule n°1:** No one has to work or update the main branch without the supervision of the Project Manager.

**Secondary rule n°2:** Any work committed outside project class should be reported to the Project Manager.

In general, any breaking of these rules shouldn't lead to a warning, but it could create potential roadblocks for the project's progression.

## Meetings

Meetings are organized regularly to discuss about the project progress:

- At the end of the project class (around 12.25 am or 4.55 pm), the project manager will discuss with the whole team to update the task list, and to gather information for filling the project report. He will need to know on what work each member has contributed and other discoveries.    
- At the end of each week, each student must fill a survey made by the Project Manager to retrieve their personal moods for a certain week.
- If necessary, a meeting outside project time (either at the ALGOSUP school or through Discord) can be organized. Depending on the team's progress, the Project Manager has the final word on the meeting's schedule.

## Retroplanning and KPIs

An file must be created to show the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with graphics to show their progress. Furthermore, a retro-planning graphic will show the progress of each task per week, and how they are organized. There will be a comparison between the expected outcome and the actual outcome.
