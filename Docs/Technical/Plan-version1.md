### Tech Plan for Adopte Un Candidat Using Flutter (Frontend Only)

#### 1. Project Scope and Objectives
**Objectives**:
- Develop a cross-platform mobile recruitment application using Flutter.
- Implement a "Tinder-style" matching process focusing on soft skills.
- Ensure the anonymization of candidates and companies.
- Provide features for messaging, profile management, and secure data handling.

**Scope**:
- User Authentication (Registration, Login, Password Recovery)
- Candidate and Company Profile Management
- Soft Skills Selection and Matching Algorithm
- Messaging System
- Anonymization and Data Security
- Multi-platform Accessibility (iOS and Android)

#### 2. Technology Stack
**Frontend**:
- **Mobile App**: Flutter

**Backend**:
- **Not Included**: Mock data and local storage will simulate backend functionality.

**Services and Tools**:
- **Local Storage**: Hive or SharedPreferences for persistent local storage.
- **State Management**: Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc.
- **Network Requests**: Dio or http package (for future backend integration).
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication (for future backend integration).
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for notifications.
- **UI Design**: Figma and Flutter for UI/UX design and prototyping.

#### 3. Architecture Design
**App Structure**:
- **Models**: Data structures for users, profiles, messages, and skills.
- **Services**: Simulated services for authentication, profile management, matching, and messaging.
- **State Management**: Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc to manage application state.
- **UI Components**: Modular and reusable components for different parts of the app.

**Data Flow**:
1. **Local Storage**: Store user data, profiles, and messages locally.
2. **State Management**: Manage the application state using a chosen state management solution.
3. **Mock Services**: Simulate backend responses and interactions.
4. **UI Components**: Render data and handle user interactions.

#### 4. Implementation Plan
**Phase 1: Requirements and Planning**
- Define detailed requirements and use cases.
- Create technical specifications and user stories.
- Design UI/UX mockups using Figma.

**Phase 2: Project Setup**
- Set up the Flutter project structure.
- Install necessary packages (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, Dio, etc.).

**Phase 3: UI Development**
- Implement authentication screens (login, registration, password recovery).
- Develop user profile management and soft skills selection UI.
- Create the matching interface inspired by Tinder's swipe functionality.
- Implement messaging functionality.

**Phase 4: State Management and Local Storage**
- Set up state management using Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc.
- Implement local storage using Hive or SharedPreferences.
- Simulate backend services for authentication, profile management, matching, and messaging.

**Phase 5: Integration and Testing**
- Integrate UI components with state management and local storage.
- Perform unit and integration testing for each module.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure all functionalities meet requirements.

**Phase 6: Deployment**
- Prepare the app for deployment on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
- Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications.
- Configure app permissions and settings for both iOS and Android.

**Phase 7: Post-Launch**
- Monitor application performance and error logs.
- Collect user feedback and iterate on features.
- Implement additional features based on user needs and market trends.

#### 5. Project Timeline
**Month 1**: Requirements gathering, planning, and design.
**Month 2-3**: Project setup, UI development, and state management.
**Month 4**: Integration and testing.
**Month 5**: Deployment preparation and app store submissions.
**Month 6**: Post-launch support and feature enhancements.

#### 6. Team Structure
- **Project Manager**: Oversee project progress, manage timelines and resources.
- **Flutter Developers**: 2-3 developers skilled in Flutter for cross-platform mobile development.
- **QA Engineers**: 2 testers for unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
- **UI/UX Designer**: Design user-friendly interfaces and ensure a consistent user experience.

This tech plan outlines the development, testing, and deployment strategy for the Adopte Un Candidat project using Flutter. The focus is on creating a user-friendly and secure recruitment application, with UI/UX designs and prototypes created using Figma.
