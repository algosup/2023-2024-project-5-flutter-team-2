## Overview

["We Are Evolution"](https://www.we-are-evolution.com/) is a group specialized in Communication, Video Marketing, and Human Ressources that was created in 2019. Composed of 3 branches (MeMedia, WEvolution and Smile Event), their mission is to make companies more attractive for candidates.

Indeed, they want to highlight companies to showcase it to candidates and win the contributors' loyalty.

In fact, the group asked the ALGOSUP school to create an App named "Adopte un Candidat": the product is a Tinder-like recruitment application whose goal is to match jobseekers with companies depending the required soft skills. Indeed, the product must provide a unique way to hire people depending on their behavorial and relational skills that are required for a certain company.

In this project, the client want us to create the prototype of the app with the expected features:
- Anonymization of candidates and companies.
- Valorization of soft skills.
- Priority given to the human aspect.
- Matching between candidates and companies.
- Entire recruitement process taking place on the app.
